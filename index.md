  SYLLABUS

  Show what topics will be covered.

  1. If your workshop is R rather than Python, remove the comment
     around that section and put a comment around the Python section.
  2. Some workshops will delete SQL.
  3. Please make sure the list of topics is synchronized with what you
     intend to teach.
  4. You may need to move the div's with class="col-md-6" around inside
     the div's with class="row" to balance the multi-column layout.

  This is one of the places where people frequently make mistakes, so
  please preview your site before committing, and make sure to run
  'tools/check' as well.

  SETUP

  Delete irrelevant sections from the setup instructions.  Each

  <h3>Python</h3>

  <p>
    <a href="https://python.org">Python</a> is a popular language for
    research computing, and great for general-purpose programming as
    well.  Installing all of its research packages individually can be
    a bit difficult, so we recommend
    <a href="https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/">Anaconda</a>,
    an all-in-one installer.
  </p>

    <p>
      Regardless of how you choose to install it,
      <strong>please make sure you install Python version 3.x</strong>
      (e.g., 3.6 is fine).
    </p>

    <p>
      We will teach Python using the <a href="https://jupyter.org/">Jupyter notebook</a>,
      a programming environment that runs in a web browser. For this to work you will need a reasonably
      up-to-date browser. The current versions of the Chrome, Safari and
      Firefox browsers are all
      <a href="https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/stable/notebook.html#browser-compatibility">supported</a>
      (some older browsers, including Internet Explorer version 9
      and below, are not).
